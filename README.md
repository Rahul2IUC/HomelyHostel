 Today  have started learning Javascript from https://www.w3schools.com/js
 What I learned::
 * JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
 * JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values
 * JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
 * JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
 * JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
 * JavaScript Display Possibilities
        JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

                 .Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
                 .Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
                 .Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
		         .Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

These two days I learned:
* JavaScript Functions and Events.
* JavaScript in <head> or <body>.
* External JavaScript.
* External JavaScript Advantages:-
	It separates HTML and code.
	It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.
	Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads. 
	#External References...
	External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
	This example uses a full URL to link to a script:
		<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script>
	This example uses a script located in a specified folder on the current web site:
		<script src="/js/myScript1.js"></script>
	This example links to a script located in the same folder as the current page:
